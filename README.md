        docker-compose up -d mariadb

DATABASE INITIALIZATION:

        # Core schema
        mysql -u$DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME < app/config/sql/sessions.sql

## Container Setup

This repository includes a lightweight Docker configuration based on the setup used in the `asbi-screening-app` project. A basic PHP/Apache image is provided along with a docker-compose file for local development.

### Build and Run

```bash
# build the container
docker-compose build

# start the container on http://localhost:8080
docker-compose up
```

### Environment Variables

Runtime configuration is provided via `default.env` which is loaded by `docker-compose`. The following variables are available:

- `FHIR_SERVER` â€“ URL of the FHIR server used by the application.

You may override these values by creating your own `.env` or editing `default.env`.

## Local Development

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for instructions on running the application with Docker.

## Generating PDF copies of instruction files

Some pages link to `.pdf` versions of the documents under `app/webroot/files/`.
These PDFs are not stored in the repository. Run `python generate_pdfs.py` from
the project root to create them locally. The script converts modern `.docx`
files to PDF and generates placeholder PDFs for older `.doc` files.
The script requires the `python-docx` and `reportlab` packages which can be
installed with `pip install python-docx reportlab`.



## Backend API

The Flask backend under `flask_backend/` exposes REST endpoints that the React frontend fetches. Docker Compose runs a `backend` service alongside the `web` frontend service. The frontend reads the API base URL from the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable.

See [docs/separation_of_duties.md](docs/separation_of_duties.md) for details on the responsibilities of each component.
